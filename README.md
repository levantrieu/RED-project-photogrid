# Photo Grid Project

Please view the site deployed site on [GitHub Pages.](http://levantrieu.github.io/RED-project-photogrid/)
*Note: Instagram has updated access permission to the API and this use case is no longer supported. Please visit [www.levantrieu.com] (http://levantrieu.com/photo-search-site-using-an-api/) to see screenshots of the app.*

**Project Brief**

This is a one page responsive website that allows a user to pull Instagram photos via the API by search for a hashtag. The photos are displayed in a responsive grid along with other data from Instagram, such as profile picture, username, likes and comments counters.

**Tools and Methods Used**

- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- Ajax request from Instagram API
- jQuery
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, large tablet and desktop)
- Gulp, SASS, Autoprefixer, Browser-Sync
- Git and GitHub

**Personal Summary**

This project was challenging in that it utilizes all of the tools and methods that we have learned in the past 3 weeks. I found the jQuery challenging to apply, although I am getting the hang of the concepts. I really enjoying working with Flexbox, it seems to behave much more predictably than floats.
